# Contributing to this USNCO Problem Archive

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :heartbeat: :100:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. It is currently still under development, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to add them in a pull request. These are guidelines, not hard and fast laws, so please exercise your best judgement and generally be respectful and nice. Additionally, note that this repository is more to store the products of code (i.e. the images parsed from the USNCO) rather than the code itself. Hence, issues with problems and solutions are likely to be prioritized above issues with the codebase.

Below are some ways that you can contribute to this repository:

## :bug: Bug Reports

If you see a bug, make sure to raise an issue in the issues section. Afterwards, it will be triaged and addressed appropriately. (To do this, click on the issues tab, then click the green "New Issue" button and describe your problem).
