# USNCO Problem Repository

This is exactly what it sounds like: a repository of problems from the USNCO, grouped by year. In the future, problems will be tagged with topics and difficulty. A discord bot will also be created to serve problems from this repository to the Chemistry Olympiad discord server.

## Usage

If you wish to query certain images, they are located at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thewindsofwinter/usnco-problems/master/tests/[section]/[year]/[number].png`, where [section] can be either `locals`, `part_i`, or `part_ii`, year is the year the problem was created in, and number is the problem number.

See an issue with a problem? Either open an issue or use this Google Form: https://forms.gle/djXXtiCeicqtHisL7.
