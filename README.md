# USNCO Problem Repository

This is exactly what it sounds like: a repository of problems from the USNCO, grouped by year. In the future, problems will be tagged with topics and difficulty. A discord bot will also be created to serve problems from this repository to the Chemistry Olympiad discord server.

## Copyright Notice

All problems on the USNCO are property of the American Chemical Society (ACS). This archive does not seek any commercial benefit on these problems, and we seek to merely archive past problems as images for chemistry educational purposes. If the original copyright holders take issue with this usage, please contact the author of this repository.

According to Section 107 of the Copyright Act:

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, **teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright**. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall includeâ€”

(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
