# USNCO Problem Repository

This is exactly what it sounds like: a repository of problems from the USNCO, grouped by year. In the future, problems will be tagged with topics and difficulty. A discord bot will also be created to serve problems from this repository to the Chemistry Olympiad discord server.

## Future To-Do
 * Clean up my ugly code
 * Record answers to problems
 * Record topics for each problem
 * Create difficulty rating system
 * Create discord bot to serve questions
 * Create website (?) to serve questions
